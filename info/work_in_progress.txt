  Prior to working on dialog boxes, fixed screen redraw issue when
  backing store is not available (COMPLETED, Dec 4)

  Summary of dialog boxes in TQGG and perhaps the priority order.
  ===============================================================
  
  /info/files - Create compound strings and display in text box. Need info from
               fortran part. Simple starting point.  (COMPLETED, JAN 18)
  
  /info/limits - Create compound strings and display in text box. Need info from
               fortran part.  (COMPLETED, JAN 18)

  /info/elementcheck - Dialog box with pushbuttons. Each button has a fortran
               callback for specific tests. Top button toggles full color
               or marker. Close on bottom.  (COMPLETED, JAN 26)

  /info/nodecheck - Multiple radio buttons for the various tests. Some require
               string input. OK and Close on bottom. OK initiates tests.  (COMPLETED)
               
  /info/nodeinfo - Multiple text areas that display info and can be changed.
                Close on bottom.(COMPLETED)
               
  /info/elementinfo - Multiple text areas that display info and can be changed.
                Button on bottom to input coordinates. Close button.(COMPLETED)

  /config/contour - Set up color table and contour levels. Add and Sutract on 
                bottom. OK and Close on bottom. (Partial fix by using prompts
                for input data)
  
  /config/data - Buttons to turn on contour or boundary data plots. File
                selection for each.
  
  /file/XSection - Set up parameters for constructing grid from cross
                sections. Requires string input boxes.
                
  There are other dialogs but I have either programmed around them or they
  are not a priority right now. The dialogs should be set up in c and bypass
  the existing fortran code. They would have to query fortran for data and call
  fortran routines for the tests.
