  Prior to working on dialog boxes, fixed screen redraw issue when
  backing store is not available (COMPLETED, Dec 4)

  Summary of dialog boxes in TQGG and perhaps the priority order.
  ===============================================================
  
  /info/files - Create compound strings and display in text box. Need info from
               fortran part. Simple starting point.  (COMPLETED, JAN 18)
  
  /info/limits - Create compound strings and display in text box. Need info from
               fortran part.  (COMPLETED, JAN 18)

  /info/elementcheck - Dialog box with pushbuttons. Each button has a fortran
               callback for specific tests. Top button toggles full color
               or marker. Close on bottom.

	From Walter to Raymond (Dec 13)
	  I just rewrote the element check code to provide an entry
	for the dialog callback. The idea is to set the colormode to
	fullcolor (true) or marker (false), then call this subroutine
	with the number for the test. The interface looks like void
	ElementCheck( int *ntest, int *colormode)

	From Walter to Raymond (Jan 20),
	  I think we should start with the simplest dialogs first. Run
	the win version to get an idea of what is contained in the dialogs.

	The easiest is the elementcheck routine. The dialog has a
	toggle on top to switch between fullcolor and markers, and
	below are individual buttons that call specific tests. All
	that is passed is a logical (fullcolour=TRUE/FALSE) and a test
	number (1-6).

	The next more complicated routines are nodecheck, nodeinfo,
	and elementinfo. These display text in boxes and some boxes are
	editable.

  /info/nodecheck - Multiple radio buttons for the various tests. Some require
               string input. OK and Close on bottom. OK initiates tests.
               
  /info/nodeinfo - Multiple text areas that display info and can be changed.
                Close on bottom.
               
  /info/elementinfo - Multiple text areas that display info and can be changed.
                Button on bottom to input coordinates. Close button.

  /config/contour - Set up color table and contour levels. Add and Sutract on 
                bottom. OK and Close on bottom.
  
  /config/data - Buttons to turn on contour or boundary data plots. File
                selection for each.
  
  /file/XSection - Set up parameters for constructing grid from cross
                sections. Requires string input boxes.
                
  There are other dialogs but I have either programmed around them or they
  are not a priority right now. The dialogs should be set up in c and bypass
  the existing fortran code. They would have to query fortran for data and call
  fortran routines for the tests.
