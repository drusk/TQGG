The grid generation program TQGG has been developed by a number of
different people and organizations over the last 20 or so years
(including http://trigrid.sourceforge.net/).  The back-end of the
program is written in FORTRAN.  The last mature version of TQGG (then
called GridGen) was a MS Windows only program with a GUI written using
Visual FORTRAN.

Currently TQGG is being developed by semi-retired coastal scientist, 
Dr. Roy A Walters.  Roy has rewritten TQGG for Linux and OSX by using a 
Motif-based C GUI and a FORTRAN back-end.  Some of the functionality of TQGG
requires interaction with dialogue boxes and menus.  A fair amount of
work has gone into getting all the menus up and running, but still
some of the dialogue boxes are not functional.  This repository
contains work in progress to finish up implementation of all the menus
and dialog boxes.

Installation notes and a Users Guide may be found in the docs subdirectory.
