The grid generation program TQGG has been developed by a number of
different people and organizations over the last 20 or so years
(including
[http://trigrid.sourceforge.net/|http://trigrid.sourceforge.net/]).
The back-end of the program is written in FORTRAN.  The last mature
version of TQGG (then called GridGen) was a MS Windows only program
with a GUI written using Visual FORTRAN.

Currently TQGG is developed by semi-retired coastal scientist and
part-time Cascadia Coast Research Ltd. employee, Roy A Walters.  Roy
has rewritten TQGG to use a Motif based C GUI with the FORTRAN
back-end compiled as libraries.  Some of the functionality of TQGG
requires interaction with dialogue boxes and menus.  Roy has gone a
long way to get all the menus up and running, but still many of the
dialogue boxes are not functional.  This repository contains work in
progress to finish up implementation of all the menus and dialog
boxes.
